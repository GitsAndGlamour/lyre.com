**Project Lyre** is an open-source social network for discovering new online courses across the web.
(Under development) The foundation of the website is built upon an existing social network that exists as a customizable workplace communication web application.

## Idea

**Project Lyre** allows users to search and filter online courses from across the web in one place in order to minimize time spent searching for courses, and increase the chances of finding the right course. With rating and reviews, finding the right online course becomes easier.

## Stack

**Project Lyre** is built using the MEAN stack which is centered around JavaScript. For more information about the different components that make up the MEAN stack, please review the links below.

1. [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/): The leading NoSQL database.
2. [Express](http://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
3. [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/): HTML enhanced for web apps.
4. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/): A platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime.
